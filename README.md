# Starcraft 2 AI learning 

Basic bot to generate training data for a convolutional neural network.
Picks 1 out of 4 avaliable decisions for it's attacking units and stores it's choice in an array.
Data is fed through 5 layers including I/O.

Goal: See if there's an improvement in the win rate of a AI with a trained neural network.
